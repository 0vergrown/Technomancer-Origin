# Technomancer Origin - Origins (Fabric) For Minecraft 1.18
So, I started working on this Origin about a month ago, it is part of a set of 5 Origins based around magic. This one being the first part of the set. I decided to go with a more technological themed magic as I think its an interesting concept that's honestly not been explored at all on Origins or even Minecraft as a whole. Yeah, we have Redstone but that is viewed as a mostly industrial element even though its used in potions thus proving it has some magical properties, the concept isn't really explored all that much so I wanted to take the time and develop an Origin that could potentially explore the concept of Technomancy in Minecraft and how much more we could expand on it if explored.

***NOTE:*** You must use the texture to get the item textures. Otherwise they are just vanilla textures and regular items.

Technomancer datapack is made for the fabric mod, [Origins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins). You must have it for this pack to work.

**This Pack Adds:**
- Custom Origin

**Origin Detail:**

Icon: Redstone <br />
Impact: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ <br />
Description: You are a powerful Technomancer. Armed with the power and knowledge of the Godfathers of Technomancy, you are able to create spells using Conduits and your staff.

*Positive ðŸŸ¢:*

- **Laser Beam:** Red Conduit: You release a powerful beam of energy capable to cutting through blocks and mobs. Mana Cost: 100 Per Use. (Right Click, Held)
- **Healing Aura:** Blue Conduit: You are able to generate a quick burst of healing nanites which, upon release, will shoot out potent healing chemicals that will heal anyone within its radius, including yourself. Mana Cost: 9000. (Primary)
- **Nanite Shield:** Light Blue Conduit: Surround yourself in nanites, preventing all health loss, but are unable to move. Mana Cost: 500 Per Second Used. (Primary)
- **Blockade:** Lime Conduit: You trap any entity in a temporary jail cell. Mana Cost: 9000. (Primary)
- **Grappling Hook:** Black Conduit: Shoot a grappling hook that allows you to swing and move around quicker. Mana Cost: 500 Per Used. (Right Click)

*Neutral ðŸŸ¡:*

- **Tech Mana:** As a Technomancer, your power to perform spells comes from natural energy sources. "Tech Mana" as it is commonly known, is your natural source used to cast spells but these are often bounded to more technologically advance Conduits. You gain Tech Mana naturally, as the world often brings little bits of electrical energy which you can use and convert into Mana, but this process is slow. Standing on top of Redstone-type blocks will absorb its energy and give you mana quicker.
- **Items:** As a Technomancer, your powers are bound to the "Staff of Aldo", a powerful mancer staff first designed by the Godfather of Technomancy, Aldo Aarif. Use the staff in your offhand and hold the Conduits in your mainhand to cast spells.

*Negative ðŸ”´:*

- **No Shield:** Because of the nature of the Nanite Shield, you don't feel the need to use a regular shield.
- **Technomancer's Curse:** Learning Technomancy is a craft of patience and sacrifice. No longer in your prime, your body worn by time, you move slower and have fewer hearts than most.
- **Vulnerable To Water:** Water damages your nanites and negates all your powers as the technological wonders are susceptible to water.
